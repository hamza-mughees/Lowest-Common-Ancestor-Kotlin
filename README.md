# [Lowest Common Ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor)

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of any two nodes *p* and *q* in a tree, or a directed acyclic graph, is the lowest/deepest node that is the ancestor of *p* and *q* (i.e. *p* and *q* are the descendents of this node). *p* and *q* are both ancestors/descendents of themselves.
